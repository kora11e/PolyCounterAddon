# PolyCounterAddon
A Blender plugin to find the heaviest objects in the scene.

## Installation
Go to Edit > Preferences > Addons > Dropdown > Install from Disk... and either select .zip file or the unzipped poly_counter.py file.

## Location of function
Layout Tab > N Panel > Poly Counter

## Features
Click "Find heaviest object" and select the mesh with highest number of polygons in the scene.

## Notes
The addon is in further development so in case of errors please contact the creator (me) via github or assosiated social media link.
When bumping versions increment both bl_info objects, one in __init__.py which is used for .zip install, and another in the main poly_counter.py file.
